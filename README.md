# MTL-Minmax
This repository contains the source code of Multi-Task Learning with Min-max Optimization and baselines from the following papers:
1) [A Min-max Optimization Framework for Multi-task Deep Neural Network Compression](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10557958) (In proceedings of ISCAS 2024);
2) A Min-max Optimization Framework for Sparse Multi-task Deep Neural Networks. (Neurocomputing accepted)

## Experiments
### Weight Pruning for Model Compression
The code in the folder `prune_apgda`, we have provided our proposed network using weight pruning strategy along with all the baselines on `NYUv2` dataset presented in the paper 1.
